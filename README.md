# Background Image Shuffler

A few projects that allow me to change my background from what it currently is, to a new URL.

## Snowbasin - Mt Ogden camera

The ski resort takes a picture once every 5 minutes during the day (every 15 minutes from 6pm to 8am), and we can update our background so it is a live view of the camera.

### CLI

you can use the command:

```
snowbasin
```

to pull images from the Mt Ogden camera.

## NASA - Image of the day

NASA has an image of the day that we can update our background on a daily basis.

### CLI

you can use the command:

```
nasa
```

to pull images from the NASA's image of the day page.

# Scheduling

## Cronjob

Easiest way to schedule something is to use the cronjob for a Mac. If you need help determining the cron syntax, I like to use https://crontab.guru/ to help me.
